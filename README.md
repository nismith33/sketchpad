# sketchpad
A website for drawing with a cursor

This web application contains a canvas for drawing. The user draws simply by dragging their cursor over the various squares in the canvas. The user may input how many squares they want per row (only options are 10,20,...,60, since values that do not evenly divide 720px occasionally cause problems with the flexbox spacing). The canvas can be reset at any time with the 'Clear Sketchboard' button. Finally, there are two drawing modes: Fill, in which touching a square instantly turns it black, and Shade, in which touching a square makes it 10% darker, so a square only becomes completely black after it is entered ten times.
